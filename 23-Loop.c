/*
Sometimes we want our programs to execute few sets
of instructions over and over again.
in these case we use loop for repeating a task more and more times

A loop in programming is a control structure that allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition.

Primarily there are three types of loops in C language:

1.while loop
2.doâ€“while loop
3.for loop
