/*Relational operators are used to evaluate conditions (true or false) inside the if statements.

Some examples of relational operators are:
==, >=, >, <, <=, !=

== -> Equality Checker
>= -> greater then or equal to
<= -> lesser than or equal to
> -> greater than
< -> lesser than

Important note: ‘=’ is used for assignment
whereas ‘==’ is used for equality check.
